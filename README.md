# Description
<p>This project was made for my recent internship which is a driving lesson booking app. It is a chatbot built with FastAPI
and Google dialogflow which allows users to book a session or ask an FAQ. This eliminates the need of a person being
there 24/7 taking in the queries from the users.</p> <br>
<p>It fetches the user input from the pop-up and process it in the backend where the data is stored in an MySQL database and then given the next option to the user</p>
<br>  
<p>Moreover you can integrate this pop-up in any site just by adding the html tag at the right place.</p>
